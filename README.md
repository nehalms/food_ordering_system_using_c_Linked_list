# Food Ordering System Using C (Linked List)

This repository contains a simple food ordering system implemented in C using linked lists. The project demonstrates the use of dynamic data structures to manage food items, process orders, and provide a basic interface for users.

## Features

- Add food items to the menu.  
- Remove or modify food items in the menu.  
- Place orders by selecting food items.  
- Calculate and display the total bill for an order.  
- Dynamic management of menu items and orders using linked lists.
